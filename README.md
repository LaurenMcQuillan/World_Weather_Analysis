# PlanMyTrip World Weather Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to collect weather data from around the world to help customers use the PlanMyTrip website to select the perfect travel destination, hotel, and travel routes based on their weather preferences.

## Results

Using APIs, I was able to pull random coordinates from around the globe and find the latitude, longitude, city, country, maximum temperature, humidity, cloudiness, wind speed, and weather description of these coordinates.  From there, the customer is able to select their ideal minimum and maximum temperature for their travel destination, and see the closest hotel to their ideal vacation spot. Using the interactive map, customers can hover over all locations that meet their weather criteria to compare different locations. Through this project, I was also able to determine the most efficient travel routes between different cities that meet the customers travel criteria.
